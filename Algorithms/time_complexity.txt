Big O Notation

for x in range(300):
    pass

n       steps
__      ___

100     200
200     400
300     600

O(n) = linear (2n but drop the coefficient)


Constant time / order 1 time
O(1) = constant (takes same amount of steps no matter how big the data set)

x = 32423

while x > 1:
    x //= 2 # forces integer division

O(log n)
